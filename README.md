# Enhancing CheXNet with Uncertainty Quantification

This repository focuses on enhancing the **CheXNet** model with uncertainty quantification techniques, building on the original work for pneumonia detection on chest X-rays.

## Baseline CheXNet

I reproduce the baseline CheXNet model as described in the main research paper:

**CheXNet: Radiologist-Level Pneumonia Detection on Chest X-Rays with Deep Learning**  
[https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1711.05225](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1711.05225)

The baseline implementation uses the **NIH Chest X-ray dataset**, available on Kaggle:  
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nih-chest-xrays/data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nih-chest-xrays/data)

This version serves as the foundation for my experiments with improved preprocessing and uncertainty quantification.
