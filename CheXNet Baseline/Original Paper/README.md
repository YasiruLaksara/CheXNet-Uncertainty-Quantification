# Original Paper Version - CheXNet Reproduction

In this folder, I attempted to reproduce CheXNet as described in the original research paper:

**CheXNet: Radiologist-Level Pneumonia Detection on Chest X-Rays with Deep Learning**  
https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1711.05225

I used the hyperparameters reported in the paper. However, there was a limitation when comparing the AUROC scores for each class because the original CheXNet test set is not publicly available.  

As a remedy, I used the NIH Chest X-ray dataset available on Kaggle for testing:
